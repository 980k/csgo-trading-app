    - HTML is used for forms such as trade creation and making trade offers.
    - HTML is used extensively with the React.js framework to create reusable UI components.
    - CSS is used to ensure responsiveness through media queries.

- **JavaScript (React.js)**

    - React.js was used for state management, page direction/routing, and client-side handling data.
    - Responsible for all of the client-side activity and rendering.

### Backend
- **JavaScript (Express.js, Node.js)**
    - Express.js is used for creating RESTful APIs for various functionalities relating to users, trades, and offers.
    - Node.js is responsible for server-side execution such as: handling API calls, middleware functionality, and database integration.

- **MongoDB**
    - MongoDB is the NoSQL data storage for data such as users, trades, and offers. All data is stored in JSON format for simplified access and processing for the frontend.
    - There are 3 different collections to organize data: Users, Trades, and Offers.
    - Utilized the _id field to reference data and relate users to trades and offers.
